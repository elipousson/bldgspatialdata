What does it mean to tidy data?  From the [Introduction of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#what-you-will-learn):

> Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored. In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.

There are numerous resources on this topic:
