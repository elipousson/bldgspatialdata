This course leverages\nopen-source tools, online educational resources, and real-world data\nfrom urban environments to help students build a methodological\nframework for academic and professional work with spatial data now and\nin the future.\n\nThe course explores the process of building and maintaining data sets\nabout local places and prepares students to navigate critical issues\nincluding data ownership, the challenges of administrative data, and\nprivacy consideration. Assignments and readings will introduce students\nto the range of uses for spatial data in planning, public policy, and\nadvocacy around housing, health, transportation, the environment, and\nmore.\n\nStudents in the course will learn to work with common file formats (e.g.\nGeoJSON, GeoPackage) and web services (e.g. FeatureServer, APIs) and how\nto read, write, document, and share data using QGIS, the R programming\nlanguage, and various web services.\n\n::: {.callout-warning appearance=\"minimal\"}\nThis course does not require any prior experience with desktop GIS\nsoftware or R programming. Assignments will require students to use R,\nRStudio, and QGIS during the course. Optional resources on working with\nspatial data using ArcGIS Online or Python will be provided where\nfeasible. Students will be required to use GitHub in order to share\ncompleted assignments and develop their professional portfolios.\n:::\n\n## Schedule overview\n\nOverall, this course is divided into three sections:\n\n| **Section**                       | **Topics**                                                                                                                                  | **Sessions/Dates**          |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Getting started with spatial data | Introduction to using R, sf, and QGIS to work with vector, raster, and tabular data.                                                        | 1 (Aug. 31) -- 6 (Oct. 5)   |\n| Building and sharing spatial data | Downloading and manipulating spatial data from Socrata, ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and other sources using R.                                   | 7 (Oct. 12) -- 12 (Nov. 16) |\n| Special topics and final project  | Use local data sources related to housing, transportation, community development, or related topics to work on a collaborative data project | 13 (Nov. 23) -- 15 (Dec. 7) |\n\nReview [the course schedule](/schedule.html) for a more outline of\ntopics, readings, and activities.\n\n## Assignments\n\nThe work for this course includes three different activities:\n\n-   Writing a **weekly log** in response to assigned readings\n\n-   Completing **lab assignments** (primarily using R and QGIS)\n\n-   Collaborating on a **final project** using spatial data\n\n### Weekly log\n\nEach week students are expected to write a 1-2 paragraph reflection the\nassigned readings and 1-3 questions related to the technical materials.\nEach weekly log entry should be committed to the \"log\" folder as a\nMarkdown (.md) file with a file name corresponding to the session date\n(e.g. \"2021-08-31_log.md\"). Weekly logs that are unrelated to the\nreadings or do not include a question will be considered incomplete but\nmay be revised and resubmitted. You are allowed to skip or miss up to\nfour weekly log entries during the course so each entry submitted beyond\n10 entries is a bonus point.\n\n### Assignments\n\nFor each assignment, students will be provided instructions or reference\nmaterials to complete a set of objectives. Assignments in R will be\nsubmitted as an R script or RMarkdown file committed to the course\nrepository. Assignments in QGIS will typically be documented with a\nbrief written report and an exported map in a PDF format also submitted\nusing the course repository.\n\nAssignments will include a clear list of objectives that must be met to\nbe considered complete. Most assignments may also include a bonus\nobjective that can earn additional points. Each assignment is\neffectively assigned points on the following scale:\n\n-   3: Assignment is submitted, complete, and includes a complete bonus\n    assignment\n\n-   2: Assignment is submitted and complete\n\n-   1: Assignment is submitted but incomplete\n\n-   0: Assignment not submitted\n\nIncomplete assignments can be revised and resubmitted for full credit.\nAssignments submitted more than one day late cannot receive a bonus\npoint. Assignments more than one week late will not be accepted barring\nexceptional circumstances.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Assignment                                            | Session due | Due date |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:--------:|\n|Complete GitHub Fundamentals                          |      3      |   9/14   |\n|Find spatial data                                     |      3      |   9/14   |\n|Read spatial data and make a map with QGIS            |      5      |   9/28   |\n|Read spatial data and make a map with R and ggplot2   |      5      |   9/28   |\n|Compare spatial and geometry operations in QGIS and R |      6      |   10/5   |\n|Document a public data set                            |      6      |   10/5   |\n|Tidy tabular address data and geocode with R          |      7      |  10/12   |\n|Georeference a historic map with QGIS                 |      8      |  10/19   |\n|Complete an exploratory analysis of a public dataset  |      9      |  10/26   |\n|Make a map using OpenStreetMap data in QGIS or R      |     13      |  11/16   |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Final project\n\nAll students will participate in a final project that can be completed\nindependently or in collaboration with other students in the class. The\nfinal project must use local spatial data and/or include the creation of\nnew spatial data about local places. Students will be encouraged to use\nR and Quarto for the creation of the final project but projects\ncompleted using QGIS are also acceptable.\n\nA draft project proposal (1-2 pages in length) must be submitted by\nNovember 9. We will review final projects as a group during the final\nclass session on December 7 and all project materials must be submitted\nin a final format by December 14.\n\nEvaluation of the final project will be based on both self-assessment by\nthe individual student or group and an instructor assessment. The\ninstruction can also offer bonus points in recognition of exceptional\nwork or, if necessary, adjust points awarded through the student\nself-assessment.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of this course is intended to help you focus on\ncompleting assignments---not getting them perfect. You can earn up to a\ntotal of 50 points in this class through writing at least 10 weekly logs\n(10 points), all 10 assignments (20 points), and subsmitting a project\nproposal and a final project (20 points). Completing additional weekly\nassignments can earn bonus points and most assignments will include 1 or\n2 bonus activities.\n\nFor the final project proposal, the project proposal may receive partial\ncredit if revisions are required but full credit when a revised proposal\nis submitted. For the final project, points will be split between the\nself-assessment and instructor evaluation based on a rubric to be\nprovided later in the semester.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|         Activity| Points | Bonus points |\n|----------------:|:------:|:------------:|\n|       Weekly log|   10   |      4       |\n|      Assignments|   20   |      10      |\n| Project proposal|   8    |      0       |\n|    Final project|   12   |      4       |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# **Statements & Policies**\n\n## **Diversity Statement on Respect**\n\nStudents in this class are encouraged to speak up and participate during\nclass meetings.
