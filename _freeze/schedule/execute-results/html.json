Most readings are free and online but a few may require you to use the [UMBC Library](https://library.umbc.edu/) Books and Media Search or AOK Article Search to locate.\n\n-   **Additional references:** Optional material (including readings and videos) that you are encouraged to use as a reference but you are not required to review before class.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo participate in this class, you need to have access to a laptop with a few applications installed: R, RStudio, and QGIS. You also need to set up a GitHub account. I've gathered a few resources with step-by-step instructions on how to install these applications along with some introductory material for any students who has no or limited prior experience with a desktop GIS or a programming language like R.\n\nTo install QGIS and get an introduction to the interface (if you do not have prior experience with a desktop GIS application), please review:\n\n-   5\\.

This session will focus on sharing updates and support for the final project. The session will not be recorded but notes will be shared with any students who are unable to participate.\n:::\n\n## 14. Special topics in spatial data -- Nov. 30\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nThere are a wide range of special topics that we could cover in this course but we don't have time to cover them all. This session is a place-holder to dig deeper into a special topic based on the interests of students in the course. Possible topics could include working with spatial network data using [sfnetworks](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/), working with time series data using the QGIS [temporal controller](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/animating_time_series.html) feature, visualizing elevation data using the [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) package, or something else.\n:::\n\n## 15. Final project review -- Dec. 7\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nThis session will be dedicated to students sharing individual and collaborative work completed for the final project. Additional details on the final project will be shared with students prior to the end of the first section of the course in early October.\n:::\n\n### Assignments due\n\n-   Final project presentation\n\n-   Final project materials (due Dec. 16)\n",
