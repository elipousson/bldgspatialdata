Your project name is also going to be the name used for your project repository.\n:::\n\n![Create Quarto Project in New Project Wizard](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-09%20at%201.05.18%20PM.png)\n\nYour new project should open in the RStudio IDE.\n\n### Connect your new project to GitHub\n\nInstall the [usethis package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) then restart R. If you already have the use this package installed you can skip this step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLoad the usethis package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(usethis)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUse the `git_sitrep()` function to check that you have GitHub set up correctly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngit_sitrep()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIf you see any error messages, review the instructions from [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) on [getting started with Git](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) or [connecting your GitHub account to RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html).\n:::\n\nMake your first commit to set up the project using the `use_git()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_git(message = \"Create new project\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf this works, the results in your console should look something like this:\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-09%20at%201.09.40%20PM.png)\n\nConfirm in your console that is OK to commit the files.\n\nAdd your local Git repository to the class GitHub organization by filling in the organization parameter for `use_github()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_github(organisation = \"bldgspatialdata22\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf this works, the results in your console should look something like this:\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-09%20at%201.10.09%20PM.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIf you have multiple GitHub accounts, make sure you use the *same* GitHub account that belongs to the course organization. Make sure you accepted the invitation to join the course organization. If you are not able to set up a new project, message Eli on Discord to double-check your permissions and send a new invitation to join the course repository if needed.\n:::\n\nYou can now add your project proposal and other files to the repository. Make sure to commit any changes to the repository using the Git pane within RStudio or using the GitHub Desktop application.\n\n### Add a README and a license to your project\n\nAdd a README to your project. Use the `use_readme_rmd()` function to create creating a README with RMarkdown.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_readme_rmd()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n#### Updating your README\n\nCreating a README with RMarkdown allows you to include executable code chunks in your README. You should render your README as a Markdown file using the `devtools::build_readme()` function any time you make changes.\n:::\n\nSelect a license and add it to your project using any of the license functions from usethis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_mit_license(\"Your Name Here\")\n\nuse_cc0_license()\n\nuse_gpl3_license()\n\nuse_ccby_license()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n#### Selecting a license\n\nThe [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/) is common license for many R packages and other open-source projects.
