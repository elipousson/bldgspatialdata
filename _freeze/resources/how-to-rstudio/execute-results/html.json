You should quit RStudio, [download and install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), then re-open RStudio and start again.\n:::\n\n![New Project Wizard in RStudio](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-09%20at%201.04.47%20PM.png)\n\nFill in the directory name with a short descriptive project name, e.g. \"explorebaltimorebirds\".\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\nMake sure to avoid using any spaces in your project name. Your project name is also going to be the name used for your project repository.\n:::\n\n![Create Quarto Project in New Project Wizard](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-09%20at%201.05.18%20PM.png)\n\nYour new project should open in the RStudio IDE.\n\n### Connect your new project to GitHub\n\nInstall the [usethis package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) then restart R. If you already have the use this package installed you can skip this step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLoad the usethis package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(usethis)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUse the `git_sitrep()` function to check that you have GitHub set up correctly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngit_sitrep()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIf you see any error messages, review the instructions from [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) on [getting started with Git](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) or [connecting your GitHub account to RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html).\n:::\n\nMake your first commit to set up the project using the `use_git()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_git(message = \"Create new project\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf this works, the results in your console should look something like this:\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-09%20at%201.09.40%20PM.png)\n\nConfirm in your console that is OK to commit the files.\n\nAdd your local Git repository to the class GitHub organization by filling in the organization parameter for `use_github()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_github(organisation = \"bldgspatialdata22\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf this works, the results in your console should look something like this:\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-09%20at%201.10.09%20PM.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIf you have multiple GitHub accounts, make sure you use the *same* GitHub account that belongs to the course organization. Make sure you accepted the invitation to join the course organization. If you are not able to set up a new project, message Eli on Discord to double-check your permissions and send a new invitation to join the course repository if needed.\n:::\n\nYou can now add your project proposal and other files to the repository. Make sure to commit any changes to the repository using the Git pane within RStudio or using the GitHub Desktop application.\n\n### Add a README and a license to your project\n\nAdd a README to your project. Use the `use_readme_rmd()` function to create creating a README with RMarkdown.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_readme_rmd()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n#### Updating your README\n\nCreating a README with RMarkdown allows you to include executable code chunks in your README. You should render your README as a Markdown file using the `devtools::build_readme()` function any time you make changes.\n:::\n\nSelect a license and add it to your project using any of the license functions from usethis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_mit_license(\"Your Name Here\")\n\nuse_cc0_license()\n\nuse_gpl3_license()\n\nuse_ccby_license()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n#### Selecting a license\n\nThe [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/) is common license for many R packages and other open-source projects. Open data is often published using a [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) (CC0) or \"No Rights Reserved\" license. The [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (GPL3), [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC-BY) license (or [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (CC-BY-SA) are other options you could consider.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\n#### Using licensed works by others\n\nIf you are using or adapting code or data from other projects, make sure you credit those projects on your README and clarify the the project repository includes material available under a different license than the license you selected for your own work. In some cases you may be required to use a specific license, such as GPL or CC-BY-SA, if you are making substantial use of an existing work published under that license.\n\nSee the [Licensing](https://r-pkgs.org/license.html) chapter from [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham, the [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) website from GitHub, or this [guide on Considerations for licensors](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors) from Creative Commons more detailed guidance on this topic.\n:::\n\n### Add and organize files in your project\n\nUsing the **File \\> New File \\> ..**. menu option you can create a files including Quarto documents and presentations, RMarkdown documents, R scripts, plain Markdown files, and many others.\n\nOnce you create the file you will want to save the file within your project folder or subfolders. There are different ways of organizing an RStudio project depending on whether you are creating a website, a blog, an R package, or something different.\n\n#### Organizing files for data analysis projects\n\nThere are some common conventions that people who use R have adopted to make file organization more predictable and easy to understand. Some of these conventions are based on the requirements for creating R packages which is one approach that is used for sharing data or interactive applications.\n\nCommon folders that are also used in R packages include:\n\n-   **data:** for data used in your analysis or visualization\n-   **R:** for any R scripts used in your analysis or project.\n\nOther common folder for data analysis projects include:\n\n-   **ouput**: for PDFs, Word documents, or images files created as the result of an analysis script\n\nThe `use_r()` function is a convenient way to create an R folder and a script.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_r(\"your-script-name\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\nReview the Ch. 4 [Efficient workflow](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html) in @gillespieEfficientProgramming2021 for a more general overview of project planning with R.\n:::\n\n#### Organizing files for Quarto websites or blogs \n\n::: callout-important\nThis section of the guide is coming soon!
