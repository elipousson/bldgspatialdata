Each week students are expected to write a 1-2 paragraph reflection the assigned readings and one to three questions related to the technical materials.

Each weekly log entry should be committed to the `log` folder as a Markdown (`.md`) file with a file name corresponding to the session date (e.g. `2022-08-31_log.md`).

Weekly logs that are unrelated to the readings or do not include a question will be considered incomplete but may be revised and resubmitted. You are allowed to skip or miss up to four weekly log entries during the course---so each entry submitted beyond 10 entries is a bonus point.

## Submitting a weekly log entry with GitHub

Weekly log entries are submitted using your personal GitHub repository in the course GitHub organization. I recommend installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to use during this course.

After you initially [set up your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account), use GitHub Desktop to clone your personal course repository to your own computer ([see documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) for more information).

Here is a typical process for submitting a log entry using RStudio and GitHub:

1.  Open the `logs.Rproj` file in the logs folder in your repository with RStudio.
2.  Locate the template file (`2022-MM-DD_log.md`) using the files pane of RStudio (you can [customize the pane layout](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-the-RStudio-IDE#pane-layout) using the options dialog for the RStudio IDE).
3.  Select the template file, make a copy (using the More \> Copy drop-down menu option), and name the new file substituting the month and date of the related session for `MM-DD` in the file name. For example, a log due on September 21, 2022 should be named `2022-09-21_log.md`.
4.  Add your own reflection and questions to the new Markdown document. *Both* a reflection *and* a question are expected for a complete log entry. Please keep the headings from the template in place. Use the [RStudio visual editor](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/) to add formatting and links as needed.
5.  Use the Git tab to commit and push the new log file to your repository:
    -   Click the Git tab
    -   Check the "Staged" check box next to the new file
    -   Click Commit
    -   Type a message in Commit message, e.g. "Add weekly log for September 7"
    -   Click Commit to confirm the addition
    -   Click Push to sync the change with the remote repository on Github.com

You can also commit and push changes using GitHub Desktop. Review the documentation on [Committing and reviewing changes to your project](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) for more information.
