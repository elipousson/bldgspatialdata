This assignment has two parts:

1.  Reading spatial data with QGIS

2.  Creating a map with QGIS

This assignment can be completed by following the linked tutorials but you are encouraged to experiment. You are welcome to use the [Natural Earth quick start kit](https://naciscdn.org/naturalearth/packages/Natural_Earth_quick_start.zip) alone or in combination with another data set from [Maryland iMap](https://data.imap.maryland.gov/) or [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/). You may use this assignment to continue exploring a data sets identified when you completed the first assignment on finding spatial data.

## Read spatial data with QGIS

The key steps for this assignment include:

1.  Read a vector dataset into QGIS.

2.  Use the Attributes toolbar and Select By Expression window to filter the data based on one or more attributes.

## Create a map with QGIS
