## How is this schedule organized

Each session includes information on:

-   **Assignments due:** Assignments are due by *11:59 PM* on the day they're listed unless otherwise noted.

-   **Topics:** A listing of the topics, questions, or skills that we expect to focus on during each course session. As of August 2022, these topics are *tentative* and may *change* during the first few weeks of the course.

-   **Examples:** Annotated R code and other supplementary information you can use as a reference for the session topics. These examples may include external links to package vignettes for R packages we are using during the session.

-   **Readings:** Readings for this class include both material on *how* to work with spatial data in R and QGIS and material on broader considerations around working with data and how spatial data is collected, organized, and shared. Most selected readings are freely available online but, for some, you may need to use the [UMBC Library](https://library.umbc.edu/) Books and Media Search or AOK Article Search to locate.

-   **Additional references:** Optional material (including readings and videos) that you are encouraged to use as a reference but you are not required to review before class.

## Setup

To participate in this class, you need to have access to a laptop with a few applications installed: R, RStudio, and QGIS. You also need to set up a GitHub account. I've gathered a few resources with step-by-step instructions on how to install these applications along with some introductory material for any students who has no or limited prior experience with a desktop GIS or a programing language like R.

To install QGIS and get an introduction to the interface (if you do not have prior experience with a desktop GIS application), please review:

-   5\. [Getting started](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html) in @qgisproject2022
-   Ch. 1 Where Do I Start? in @cutts2018 (available via [UMBC Library](https://library.umbc.edu/))

To install R and RStudio and get an introduction to how R works, please review:

-   Ch. 1 [Install R and RStudio](https://stat545.com/install.html) and Ch. 2 [R Basics and Workflows](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html) in @bryanSTAT545Data2019

To set up GitHub account and learn how to connect your account to RStudio, please review:

-   [Installation](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html#install-intro) and [Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html#connect-intro) from @bryanHappyGitGitHub2022

There are a wide range of special topics that we could cover in this course but we don't have time to cover them all. This session is a place-holder to dig deeper into a special topic based on the interests of students in the course. Possible topics could include working with spatial network data using [sfnetworks](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/), working with time series data using the QGIS [temporal controller](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/animating_time_series.html) feature, visualizing elevation data using the [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) package, or something more. We will finalize the topic for this session by the end of the first section of the course in early October.

## 16. Final project review -- Dec. 7

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
This session will be dedicated to students sharing individual and collaborative work completed for the final project. Additional details on the final project will be shared with students prior to the end of the first section of the course in early October.
